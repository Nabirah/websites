            <P class="para">Maharani's Science College for Women in Mysore was established 
                in 1917 by the Queen Regent of Mysore, Kempa Nanjammani Vani Vilasa Sannidhana the mother of Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV. 
                Since its inception the college has held an important place in promoting women's education.Originally the college 
                offered both Arts and Science education at undergraduate level but in 
                

                Governor
                After India's constitution into a republic in 1950, the last ruling Maharaja Jayachamaraja 
                Wadiyar ceded the kingdom into the republic. However, like most kings in India at that time, 
                the maharaja and his successors were allowed an annual payment (the privy purse), certain privileges, 
                and the use of the title "Maharaja of Mysore."[a][14] Nevertheless, with the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India,
                [15][16][17] titles and privy purse all ended. With this, the role was replaced with Rajpramukh of Mysore, 
                later renamed Governor of Mysore (now Governor of Karnataka). The role was thus incorporated into the democratic system, 
                the governor being recommended by the Government of India and appointed by the President.[18]
